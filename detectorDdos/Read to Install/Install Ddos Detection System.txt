1.Installing the Snort IDS (using the NIDS mode)

2. Create a file named "alerts.csv" and a file named "logAttack" inside / var / log / snort /

obs: can be created inside any folder and with any name, as long as the path within the CsvController class is changed into the CSV file and the LOG file.


3. Copy file "j48.rules" and "randomtree.rules" into the / etc / snort / rules folder (if the folder does not exist, it must be created).


4. When snort is installed, check that snort.conf is in / etc / snort /, if it is in another folder, it should be moved to that path.


5. Run the command "snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i networkAserMonitored" in the terminal notice that in networkAserMonitorada must be informed the network that will be monitored, eg eth0.


6. Run the developed IDS, informing the host Ip to be monitored, the algorithm and the desired rule, and click the execute button.

7. Then run the command "snort -c snort.conf", inside the / etc / snort / folder.

8. To check if you have detected an attack, open the logAtaque file.
